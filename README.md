## **Implementation of Bayesian Optimization**

![Bayesian Rule](https://github.com/ArijitChakrabarti/Bayesian-Optimization-HyperOpt-Arijit/blob/main/bayes%20rule.png?raw=true)

This Github repository is a companion to the article on LinkedIn, which describes the intuition behind the Python code which is a part of this repository.

The code itself has the following elments:

 1. Using poly1d method to create the objective function to minimize.
 2. Understanding the domain space
 3. Creating and evaluating the surrogate function against a random function\
 
 The net takeout from this notebook is that BO help speed up the process of reaching the global minima fastest - despite requiring a a few extra steps to understand the next values to use.
